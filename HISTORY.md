###  V2.0

This tag implements working Qualitative Best-effort synthesis code for (Maximally permissive) Reachability objective. The safety objective code does not synthesize Maximally permissive BE Safety strategy. 

The main methods can be found in `src/strategy_synthesis/best_effort_syn.py` and `src/strategy_synthesis/best_effort_safe_reach.py` scripts. The Qualitative algorithms correctly implement Qual BE Reachability. The Quant BE Reachability and derived class are incorrect as per the definition of Best-Effort.
