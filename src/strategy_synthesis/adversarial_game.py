class ReachabilityGame:
    """
    A class that implements a Reachability algorithm to compute a set of winning region and the
    corresponding winning strategy for both the players in a Game G = (S, E). A winning strategy induces a play for the
    system player that satisfies the winning condition i.e to reach the accepting states on a given game.

    S : Set of all states in a given Game S = (S1 U S2) and (S1 âˆ© S2 = nullset)
    W1 : Is the winning region for the system player from which it can force a visit to the accepting states
    W2 : Set compliment of W1 (S\W1) is the winning region for the env player

    For a Reachability game the goal in terms of LTL could be written as : F(Accn States) i.e Eventually
    reach the accepting region. A strategy for the sys ensures that it can force a visit to the accn states from W1
    while the strategy for the env player is to remain in W2 or the trap region.

    Graph : The graph G is a two player game played between the system and the env player assuming env to be fully
    adversarial. G should be total and every node in G should be assigned a player

    The code does a sanity check to ensure that every state has an outgoing edge and has a player assigned to it. A
    state that does not have an edge is added a self-loop with weight 0 and a state that does not have a player
    assigned is assigned as sys's (eve) state.
